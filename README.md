# starting-react
An intro to front end development with react

* This is an application for tracking expenses. This project was to give me a solid understanding of react basics by working with components, state, events as well as rendering lists and conditional content.

* In react we pass data down to children components by using props, but child components do not pass data back to the parent components. One of the challenges I faced in learning react is that you can pass pointers to functions back to parent components essentially allowing you bottom up communication.
